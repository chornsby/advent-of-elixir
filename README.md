# Advent of Elixir

Solutions to the [Advent of Code][0] programming puzzles, written in [Elixir][1]
using [Livebook][2] interactive notebooks.

## Getting started

- Make sure you have installed [Elixir][1] and [Livebook][2]
- Open Livebook and navigate to the year and day of interest
- Run the "Setup" cell to install dependencies
- Run the "Solution" cell to see the puzzle solved in the doctests

## Running with your own puzzle inputs

- Log in to [Advent of Code][0]
- Download your puzzle input
- Move the file to `<year>/files/day<number>.txt`
- Follow the "Getting started" instructions to run the notebook

Note that the doctests will almost certainly fail because your puzzle input will
have a different answer to mine.
